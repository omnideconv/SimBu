Description: SimBu can be used to simulate bulk RNA-seq datasets with known cell type fractions. 
    You can either use your own single-cell study for the simulation or the sfaira database. 
    Different pre-defined simulation scenarios exist, as are options to run custom simulations.
    Additionally, expression values can be adapted by adding an mRNA bias, which produces more
    biologically relevant simulations.
